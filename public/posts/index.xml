      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an opportunity to do an internal presentation within my organisation. The topic I talked about was &amp;ldquo;How to be a Software Engineer in 2025?&amp;rdquo; Let me try to write this as a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-technology-a-journey-through-time&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Technology: A Journey Through Time&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of us have spent years in this fast-paced industry, witnessing firsthand the remarkable evolution of technology. We saw the emergence of Angular and React, transforming traditional web development beyond HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We experienced how JSTL modernized JSPs and how ESB tools like IIB and Camel revolutionized enterprise integration. We watched as organizations shifted from legacy mainframes to agile, cloud-native systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-theory-to-practice-building-next-gen-incident-management-with-mcp-architecture&#34;&gt;From Theory to Practice: Building Next-Gen Incident Management with MCP Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://thatsmeadarsh.github.io/posts/guide-for-software-engineers-2025/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I explored the theoretical foundations of sustainable AI usage and introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a transformative approach for software engineers. Fast forward to our recent company MCP Hackathon, where theory met reality in the most exciting way possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What started as concepts on paper became a fully functional intelligent incident management system that demonstrates the true potential of smart orchestration, agent-to-agent communication, and resource-conscious AI integration. This is the story of how we brought those ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
